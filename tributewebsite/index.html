                <h2> Academic and writing career </h2>
                <p>
                    After the end of World War I in 1918, Tolkien's first civilian job was at the Oxford English
                    Dictionary,
                    where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the
                    letter W. In mid-1919, he began to tutor Oxford undergraduates privately, most importantly those of
                    Lady
                    Margaret Hall and St Hugh's College, given that the women's colleges were in great need of good
                    teachers
                    in their early years, and Tolkien as a married academic (then still not common) was considered
                    suitable,
                    as a bachelor don would not have been.

                    In 1920, he took up a post as reader in English language at the University of Leeds, becoming the
                    youngest member of the academic staff there. While at Leeds, he produced A Middle English Vocabulary
                    and
                    a definitive edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with E. V. Gordon; both became academic
                    standard
                    works for several decades. He also translated Sir Gawain, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo, but the translations
                    would not be published until 1975. In 1924, he was promoted from a readership at Leeds to a
                    professorship.

                    In October 1925, he returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a
                    fellowship at Pembroke College. During his time at Pembroke College, Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and
                    the
                    first two volumes of The Lord of the Rings, while living at 20 Northmoor Road in North Oxford. In
                    1932,
                    he published a philological essay on the name "Nodens", following Sir Mortimer Wheeler's unearthing
                    of a
                    Roman Asclepeion at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, in 1928.
